"""
This module contains the ParameterBasedFewShotFunction class, which is a subclass of
AbstractFewShotFunction. It implements a few-shot function using dynamic, on-demand examples
based on the function parameters to guide the model's behavior.

The ParameterBasedFewShotFunction class constructs the examples dynamically at runtime, taking
into account the specific parameters with which the function is called. This allows the model
to adapt to various inputs and provide more tailored outputs.
