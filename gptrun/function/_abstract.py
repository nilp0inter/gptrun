"""
This module contains the AbstractFewShotFunction class, which serves as a base class for
implementing different types of few-shot functions. These functions are defined using
few-shot prompting techniques, which may include examples, custom code, or any other methods
that subclasses define to instruct the model on the desired behavior.

Subclasses should implement methods for building the few-shot prompt based on user input,
which may vary depending on the specific technique employed by the subclass.
