"""
This module contains the ChatAPI and CompletionAPI classes, which are subclasses of
AbstractLLMRunner. They implement LLM runners specifically for OpenAI's Chat and Completion APIs,
respectively.

These classes provide the necessary methods for connecting to the OpenAI APIs, executing the
model, and handling errors or validations.
