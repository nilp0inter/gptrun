"""
This module contains the DoctestBasedFewShotFunction class, which is a subclass of
AbstractFewShotFunction. It implements a few-shot function using doctests to provide examples
that guide the model's behavior.

The DoctestBasedFewShotFunction class processes the provided doctests and converts them
into a suitable format for the few-shot prompting technique. The resulting function is then
ready to be executed with the desired inputs.
